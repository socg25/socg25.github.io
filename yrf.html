    Call for Papers: Computational Geometry: Young Researchers Forum (CG:YRF) 2025
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">        
    <p>
      The 41st International Symposium on Computational Geometry (SoCG 2025) is
      planned to be held in Kanazawa, Japan, June 23-27, 2025. It brings
      together the global community of researchers who work on a large variety of
      aspects that combine geometry, algorithms and applications. To allow a
      broad audience to actively participate in the community's major scientific
      event, this year SoCG will again be accompanied by a series of satellite
      events, which together constitute "CG Week 2025".
    </p>
    <p>
      One of these satellite events will be the "Computational Geometry: Young
      Researchers Forum" (CG:YRF), which is aimed at current and recent students.
      The active involvement by students and recent graduates in research,
      discussions, and social events has been a longstanding tradition in the CG
      community. Participation in a top-level event such as SoCG can be
      educating, motivating, and useful for networking, both with other students
      and with more senior scientists.
    </p>

    <p>
      The YRF presents young researchers (defined as not having received a formal
      doctorate before January 1, 2023) an opportunity to present their work (in
      progress as well as finished results) to the CG community in a friendly,
      open setting. Just like in the main event, presentations will be given in
      the form of talks. A pre-screening (but no formal review process) will
      ensure appropriate quality control.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">  
  <div class="card-header">
    Submission guidelines
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p>
      The idea of the event is for young researchers to present new and ongoing
      work. Therefore, the work should not have appeared in print in a formally
      reviewed proceedings volume or journal by the time of submission deadline,
      and at least one author must be a young researcher.
    </p>
    <p>
      Topics must fit into the general context of SoCG, as described in the call
      for SoCG submissions <a href="https://socg25.github.io/socg.html">https://socg25.github.io/socg.html</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Submissions must be formatted according to the same style file as regular
      SoCG submissions and not exceed 80 lines, excluding front matter and
      references. Unlike SoCG, YRF is not employing double-blind reviewing this
      year. To ensure an accurate line counting, authors must use the LaTeX class
      file <a href="https://computational-geometry.org/guidelines/socg-lipics-v2021.cls">socg-lipics-v2021</a>,
      which is a wrapper around the standard LIPIcs class, see these
      <a href="https://computational-geometry.org/old/guidelines/linecount_2022_09_19.pdf">guidelines</a>.
      Authors should refrain from putting excessive amounts of texts in parts in
      which lines are not counted automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Submissions can contain an appendix of arbitrary length to provide further
      details for the screening process, but the main body of the text should be
      understandable without reading the appendix. Appendices will also not be
      contained in the booklet (see below).
    </p>
    <p>
      Accepted abstracts will be compiled in a booklet of abstracts that will be
      distributed among the participants; this should not be considered a formal
      publication. In particular, participants are encouraged to submit (an
      extended version of) their presented work to a conference with formal
      proceedings and/or to a journal. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The work must be presented at CG:YRF by an author who is a young
      researcher. Otherwise, it will be removed from the program.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will employ a two-phase screening process. After the first review phase,
      there will be a notification of either rejection (if the result is clearly
      out of scope or technically incorrect), or conditional acceptance,
      accompanied with a description of required changes to be made (either with
      respect to content or format). In the second phase, we will check whether
      the changes have been implemented satisfactorily, and if not, a paper may
      still be rejected. The screening process is intended to ensure the
      technical quality of the presented work. Submissions that are not
      well-written risk rejection, irrespective of correctness. Authors are
      strongly encouraged to have their submissions proofread by their advisor or
      another experienced scientist.

    Early submission
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p>
      Some young researchers need more time to arrange for travel, visas, or
      funding. Authors are thus welcome to submit before the deadline above, in
      order for the submission to be reviewed earlier (including earlier
      notification of acceptance, rejection or conditional acceptance). Please
      notify the PC chair after you have made such an early submission.
    </p>
    <p>
      All submissions will be judged according to the same standards of quality
      regardless of the submission date. It is acceptable to have parallel
      submission of the same results to SoCG and YRF; however, it is expected
      that the YRF submission will be withdrawn if the full paper is accepted to
      SoCG. The reviewing for YRF is completely independent of the reviewing for
      SoCG.
