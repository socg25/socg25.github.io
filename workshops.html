    Call for Workshops: CGWeek 2025
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">        
    CGWeek 2025 will take place on June 23 - 27, 2025, in Kanazawa, Japan, anchored by the 41st International Symposium on Computational Geometry (SoCG).
    SoCG brings together a global community of researchers working on a large variety of topics that combine geometry, topology, algorithms, and applications.
    To allow a broad audience to participate actively in the community's major scientific event, a series of half-day events will be organized throughout CGWeek.
    Some of these events are workshops on topics related to all aspects of computational geometry and its applications.

    <p>
      Typical workshops feature some number of invited speakers and/or contributed talks.
      Note that we encourage organizers to consider posting an open call for contributed talks,
      in addition to having specific invited speakers, in order to broaden CGWeek participation and attendance.
      Workshop organizers are encouraged to start their workshop with an overview presentation of the state-of-the-art,
      accessible for the usual audience of CGWeek, before featuring more specialized talks.
      Events may include other forms of presentations, such as software demos, panel discussions, industry forums, tutorials,
      posters, videos, implementation challenges, or artwork.
      Discussion among workshop participants is encouraged.
      CGWeek workshops will have no formal proceedings.
      Optionally, the organizers may coordinate with journals to publish special issues,
      or arrange for other dissemination (via arXiv, webpages, or printed booklets, for example).
      We expect most events to last one morning or afternoon (3-4 hours), but some events may extend across two half-days.
    </p>
    <p>
      CGWeek 2025 is planned as an in-person event in Kanazawa.
      Some allowances may be made for online participation by workshop participants,
      subject to the policies of CGWeek as described on the conference registration page, which includes registration for CGWeek.

    Possible Topics
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p>
      We invite proposals for events focusing on all topics of potential interest to the computational geometry community.
      For examples of previous CGWeek workshops, please refer to the conference websites for 2012-2024, accessible from the Computational Geometry Pages.

    Budget
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p>
      We anticipate that CGWeek workshops will be operated at low cost.
      In particular, CGWeek does not have a budget to support invited workshop speakers, and workshop speakers are expected to register for CGWeek.
      However, each workshop may apply to the CG Workshop chairs (with final approval granted by local organizers),
      for registration fee to be waived for one workshop participant (e.g., an invited speaker),
      provided they make a convincing argument that this benefit is essential to enable the corresponding person to attend.
      For example, this could be used to invite a local person who is not primarily in computational geometry or topology,
      and hence is unlikely to attend the rest of the conference.
      Moreover, workshop organizers may provide, from their own grants or from other sponsors, a budget for invited speakers.
      CGWeek organizers will provide organizational assistance, including registration, meeting rooms at the CGWeek venue, coffee breaks, wireless network,
      and a link to the web page of the event.

  <div class="card-body">
    <p>
      For planning purposes, prospective workshop organizers are requested (but not required) to notify the Steering Committee (as workshop organizers)
      of their intent to submit a proposal by February 14, 2025.
    </p>
    <p>
      Formal proposals should be submitted by email to the SC (at <a href="mailto:socg-sc-24-26@listen.uni-bonn.de">socg-sc-24-26@listen.uni-bonn.de</a>),
      by February 28, 2025.
      Informal enquiries may be directed to Maike Buchin (at <a href="mailto:maike.buchin@ruhr-uni-bochum.de">maike.buchin@ruhr-uni-bochum.de</a>).
      Proposals should be brief (at most 3 typeset pages) and should include the following information:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Title or theme of the workshop/minisymposium/event</li>
      <li>Name and email address of the organizer(s)</li>
      <li>Brief scientific summary and discussion of the merits of the topic as it relates to computational geometry</li>
      <li>A description of the proposed format and agenda</li>
      <li>Proposed duration (both minimum and ideal)</li>
      <li>Procedures for selecting participants and presenters (which part of the workshop is dedicated to open submissions?)</li>
      <li>Intended audience (which part of the workshop is intended for the general CGWeek audience, and which part is devoted to specialists?)</li>
      <li>Potential invited speakers/panelists (confirmed?)</li>
      <li>Budget considerations (e.g., possible sponsors for invited speakers), if applicable</li>
      <li>Plans for dissemination (such as journal special issues), if applicable</li>
      <li>Past experience of the organizer(s) relevant to the event</li>
