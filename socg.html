    <p>
      SoCG is dedicated to providing an environment that is free from harassment, bullying, discrimination, and retaliation for all participants.
      Starting in 2025, CG Week including SoCG will be organized as an event of the <a href="https://computational-geometry.org/society/">CG Society</a>.
      All members of the Society are bound by its <a href="https://computational-geometry.org/society/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>.
      Only members of the Society can give a presentation and hence at least one author of each accepted paper must become a member of the Society.
      Society membership is free.

        <h5>Paper types</h5>
        <p>
	  When writing or evaluating a SoCG paper, it is important to keep in
	  mind that there are different types of contributions, each with its
	  own strengths. To ensure that a submission is evaluated on its own
	  merits, authors will need to identify the main strengths of their
	  submission, as captured by four possible paper types. PC members and
	  external reviewers will be asked to take into account these paper
	  types together with their associated evaluation criteria when they
	  evaluate a paper. There are no quotas for the paper types and
	  submissions can be labeled with more than one paper type at the time
          of submission.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Mathematical Foundations:</b> 
            A typical paper will contain theorems and proofs describing new results in discrete 
            or combinatorial geometry, discrete differential geometry or topology, or in topological 
            combinatorics. The paper will primarily be evaluated on its technical depth, the importance 
            of the results, the elegance of the solution, the connection of the problem studied 
            to computational geometry and topology, and the potential future impact on algorithm 
            development.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Algorithmic Complexity:</b> 
            A typical paper will contain algorithms, data structures, theorems, 
            proofs, or lower bound constructions describing new results on computational 
            geometry problems. The paper will primarily be evaluated on the (mathematical or 
            computational) relevance and importance of the problem studied, its technical depth, 
            the elegance of the solution, and the potential future impact of the results or the 
            proposed new methods and techniques.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Experiments and Implementation:</b> 
            A typical paper will make a clear contribution to the implementation and evaluationp of geometric 
            algorithms, such as exact, approximate, or algebraic computation, algorithms engineering, or the 
            experimental evaluation of competing algorithmic approaches. The paper will primarily be evaluated 
            on the completeness and the expected impact of the proposed implementation, the soundness of the experiments, 
            the quality and quantity of testing, and on the general amount of knowledge gained.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Applications:</b> 
            A typical paper will describe the modeling and algorithmic choices made when developing or adapting computational 
            geometry techniques for an application area. The paper will be primarily evaluated on the soundness of the modeling 
            decisions, the ingenuity of the solution, the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the expected impact in the application 
            area. One might also consider the lesson learned regarding the applicability or suitability of computational geometry 
            tools to the specific area.

	<h5>Double Blind and PC submissions</h5>
	<p>
	  SoCG will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process, and will allow PC members (other than the PC chairs) to submit to the conference as well.
	  Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way.
	  In particular, authors' names, affiliations, funding information, and email addresses should not appear in the submission.
	  Authors should ensure that any references to their own related work is in the third person (e.g., not "We build on our previous work ..." but rather "We build on the work of ...").
	  Particular care needs to be taken if there is any accompanying software or data, which needs to be linked anonymously (for example, via a DropBox anonymous folder or <a href="https://anonymous.4open.science/">Anonymous GitHub</a>, perhaps with a subset of synthetic data if the real data is not anonymized).
	  Upon registering a submission, the authors will declare conflicts of interest with PC members, as well as listing email address or domain level conflicts (i.e. “Haitao Wang (University of Utah)”, “All (Graz University of Technology)”) of other professional or personal conflicts.
	  This includes past advisors and students, people with the same affiliation, and any recent/frequent coauthors and collaborators.
	  Please refer to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QNR3JUe_DimGP79EbcmayUi7I3obiTdxAIzXMFxaCfI/pub">SoCG 2025 Conflict of Interest Guidelines</a> for a detailed discussion of possible conflicts of interest.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The purpose of lightweight double-blind reviewing is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try.
	  Authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would.
	  For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas.
	  We encourage authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing to contact the PC chairs, or to see the more detailed discussion in <a href="https://computational-geometry.org/documents/Double_blind_proposal.pdf">the proposal</a> that preceded the vote to move to double blind. 
	</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
	<h5>Format</h5>
	<p>
	  Submissions must be formatted in accordance with the <a href="https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics">LIPIcs proceedings guidelines</a>.
	  Authors are required to use the LaTeX class file <a href="https://computational-geometry.org/documents/socg-lipics-v2021.cls">socg-lipics-v2021.cls</a> (V0.9, Sep 19, 2022), with the option “anonymous”; note that the class file is a wrapper around the standard LIPIcs class.
	  The LIPIcs style and instructions are available <a href="https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/5#author">here</a>; the SoCG class file is available <a href="https://computational-geometry.org/documents/socg-lipics-v2021.cls">here</a>, and instructions on how to use it are available <a href="https://computational-geometry.org/documents/linecount_2022_09_19.pdf">here</a>.
	  Submissions must not exceed 500 lines, excluding front matter (title), references, and a clearly marked appendix (further described below), but including all other lines (in abstract, algorithms, tables, captions, etc.).
	  The class files provide line counting which should be accurate in most cases.
	  Authors should refrain from putting excessive amounts of text in parts in which lines are not counted automatically.
	  If authors need constructs that contain uncounted lines of text, they should compensate for this by reducing the final line count accordingly.
	  It is the sole responsibility of the authors not to exceed 500 lines even if some lines are not counted automatically.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
	<h5>Contents of the submission</h5>
	<p>
	  Papers should be submitted in the form of an extended abstract, which begins with the title of the paper, as well as a short abstract. This should be followed by the main body of the paper that begins with a precise statement of the problem considered, a succinct summary of the results obtained (emphasizing the significance, novelty, and potential impact of the research), and a clear comparison with related work. The remainder of the extended abstract should provide sufficient details to allow the program committee to evaluate the validity, quality, and relevance of the contribution. Clarity of presentation is very important; the entire extended abstract should be written carefully, taking into consideration that it will be read and evaluated by both experts and non-experts, often under tight time constraints. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  In addition, authors are asked to avoid "et al." in citations in favor of an equal mention of all authors' surnames. For instance, if the number of authors is large, consider writing "The authors in [#] show" instead of "A et al. [#] show".
	</p>
      </li>            
      <li class="list-group-item">
	<h5>Appendix and additional data</h5>
	<p>
	  All details needed to verify the results must be provided.
	  Supporting materials, including proofs of theoretical claims and experimental details, that do not fit in the 500-line limit should be given in an appendix.
	  If more appropriate, the full version may be given as the appendix.
	  In both cases, however, the authors should include in the main part specific pointers to the relevant locations in the appendix.
	  The appendix will be read by the program committee members and subreviewers at their discretion and will not be published as part of the proceedings.
	  Thus, the paper without the appendix should be able to stand on its own.
	  Experimental and implementation results (independent of paper type) must be reproducible and verifiable.
	  Authors of all types of papers are encouraged to put accompanying software and relevant data, if there is any, in a repository accessible to the reviewers.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
	<h5>Previous or simultaneous submissions</h5>
	<p>
	  Results previously published or accepted for publication in the proceedings of another
	  conference cannot be submitted. Simultaneous submissions of the results to another conference
	  with published proceedings are not allowed. Exempted are workshops and conferences without formal
	  proceedings, but possibly with handouts containing short abstracts. In particular, submissions of
	  papers that have appeared or will be submitted to EuroCG are allowed, since EuroCG does not publish formal
	  proceedings, while submissions of papers that have appeared in CCCG are not allowed. Results that have already
	  been accepted (with or without revision) for publication in a journal at the time of their submission
	  to the symposium are not allowed.

	  matter and references), but must not comprise any appendix. If any
	  supporting material (including complete proofs of theoretical
	  claims and experimental details) does not fit in the specified
	  limit, then the full version of the paper containing this
	  information must be referenced in the conference version
	  and made available at a public repository, such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a>,
	  by the time the final version is submitted. Where applicable, we encourage the
	  authors to make accompanying software and/or data publicly
	  accessible, with proper references in the paper.
